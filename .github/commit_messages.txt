chore: daily heartbeat update ⚡
fixed bug that only occured every 999 years
I have no idea what I'm doing
it works on my machine ✨
TODO: fix this later
future me, please forgive me 🙏
I am sorry
this will definitely break in production
and so the adventure begins...
TODO: write a better commit message
WIP: don't merge this
I promise this is the last time I will change the GUI this year...
I promise this is the last time I will change the database query this year...
I would like to be the infra/pipeline who has seen more things that completed successfully just in case
Are you still there?
My life for Aiur ⚔️
One does not simply merge into main
It's dangerous to go alone, take this commit
I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that
All in a day's work
This is not a bug, it's a feature
TODO: make this code understandable
I don't always commit code, but when I do, I don't test it
Future me, please don't hate me for this
Merge branch 'develop' into main
just pushing some code around
keeping things organized
maintaining the green dot 🟢
automated love ❤️
the cycle continues
heartbeat detection active
system still alive
pulse detected
steady as she goes
all good here
keeping the streak alive
another day in the books
checking in from the void
signal received
maintaining continuity
the wait continues
still here, still coding
day another day
consistency is key
the beat goes on
